MingqianWang responsible for CLI student part, JuntingYe responsible for CLI admin part, WeijieHe responsible for GUI part

The project file I uploaded this time is named UTSSD. After opening it, there is a module named src inside. After clicking on it, there are two packages, CLIUniApp and GUIUApp, corresponding to the CLI project and GUI project. All the code of this project has undergone multiple platform and multiple IDE tests and has been proven to run. If there is a problem, please check if it is related to the file path or some external library calls. I hope the testing goes smoothly, If you have any questions, please contact Mingqian.Wang-1@student.uts.edu.au, thank you very much!
